I began with the basics of Python and gradually explored essential libraries for machine learning. I learned to use NumPy for mathematical operations, arrays, and vectorization; Pandas for data manipulation and handling CSV files; and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing datasets. I also explored Scikit-learn for implementing machine learning algorithms.

To strengthen my understanding, I completed a follow-up assignment that reinforced the concepts I had learned.

In the third week, I delved into various machine learning methodologies and their real-world applications. I studied the fundamentals of supervised learning, focusing on regression and classification models, and touched upon clustering techniques in unsupervised learning.

I also explored the yfinance library and applied supervised learning to design a basic trading algorithm. This was followed by a hands-on assignment that included real-world applications of linear regression, logistic regression, and yfinance integration.

Overall, the course has given me a solid understanding of how machine learning can be applied to real-life problems and how it can be integrated with financial data to develop algorithmic trading systems.
